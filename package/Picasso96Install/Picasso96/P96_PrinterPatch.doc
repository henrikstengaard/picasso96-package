Picasso96 Printer Patch 1.11
============================

1. What does the patch do?

The Amiga printer.device driver will always assume that the bitmap data it
has to print is in a specific format. As it happens, the screens and windows
which reside in a graphics card memory buffer may not be in the format the
printer.device expects. Consequently, it will not print properly. The
Picasso96 Printer Patch program tries to address this problem by converting
the data to print into a format suitable for use with the Amiga printer.device.

2. What else does the program do?

High- and truecolour image data is automatically converted into a format
suitable for output with the printer.device driver. The conversion also
takes place for image data that uses a wider palette range than supported
by the printer.device API: for the original Amiga printer.device, only
up to 4096 colours per image can be used, a graphics card can allow up to
24 million colours per image. The conversion process attempts to "fold"
the picture's colour information into a 12 bit colour space. In order to
do so, a colour reduction process needs to be applied which attempts to
reproduce the original image as closely as the limited colour space allows.

3. How does the patch work?

The patch waits for somebody to open the Amiga printer.device driver. Once
it opens, monitoring patches are installed which check for a bitmap printing
command. When these patches hit upon such a command, they examine the type
of the bitmap. If the bitmap is in a format understood by the Picasso96
system (but not by the printer.device), a replacement bitmap will be created
which will be in a format understood by printer.device. This very bitmap will
then be forwarded to the printer.device in place of the original bitmap
submitted to it.

4. What else does the program need?

The P96_PrinterPatch program requires an Amiga with MC68020 CPU (or better)
and rather a lot of free memory. At 600 DPI, an A4 sized colour page will
take up about 3 MBytes of memory. If you don't have enough room available
to keep an entire page in memory, then P96_PrinterPatch will be unable to
perform its job. Above all, P96_PrinterPatch needs the Picasso96 RTG system
to read and decode the bitmap data.

5. How to install the program?

Just copy the P96_PrinterPatch program to your WBStartup drawer. That's all.

6. How to stop the program?

Just start the program again, it will automatically shut down and
remove itself from memory. Note that if the program is currently printing,
it may take a while for it to remove itself.

7. How to configure the program?

The program can be started both from Shell and from Workbench. In both
cases you can configure two options which control how the resulting picture
is generated:

   REDUCE

      This option controls whether the colour space reduction process should
      take place or not. If enabled, the picture data is converted, trying to
      retain as much colour information as possible before it is cropped to
      the 12 bit colour space. This reduction uses a technique known as
      random dithering, which causes the picture to look somewhat grainy
      when it finally comes out of the printer. This dithering technique
      has the advantage of not interfering with whatever other dithering
      technique the printer.device may add. It actually looks and works best
      with error dispersing dithering techniques like the Floyd & Steinberg
      filter supported by printer.device.

      Example: REDUCE=YES
               REDUCE=NO

      Default: REDUCE=YES

   NOISE

      The random dithering algorithm used by the colour reduction filter
      can be tuned to incorporate additional noise. Generally, the more
      frequent the noise is, the more colour will survive during the
      reduction process, but this happens at the expense of "roughing up"
      the resulting picture. With the NOISE parameter you can determine
      the noise frequency with 0 being the minimum (= no extra noise)
      and 16 being the maximum (= highest frequency noise):

      Example: NOISE=0
               NOISE=1

      Default: NOISE=2

8. How compatible is the patch?

The patch was written for the original Amiga printer.device driver, not for
smart replacements which actually know how to read bitmaps allocated by
RTG systems, such as Picasso96. In such cases, the results produced by
P96_PrinterPatch may be suboptimal. Also, other patches which compete for
the same resources as P96_PrinterPatch (namely the printer.device driver)
may interfere with P96_PrinterPatch's actions. Take care. Another point
worth mentioning is that P96_PrinterPatch will require a lot of memory to
perform its services. As said above, an A4 sized full colour page will
at 600 DPI take up about 3 MBytes of memory.
